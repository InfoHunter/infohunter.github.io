My name is Andrew Carter. I live near Seattle, WA. I am currently a software engineer at [Flipboard](http:/www.flipboard.com).

I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington and graduated in 1994. I've been in software engineering professionally since 1992. My past roles include [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com), [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com), [Getty Images](http://www.gettyimages.com), and [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com). I've also spent some time at early stage startups.

My professional focus is broadly in what is now known as *cloud services* but it has been called many things throughout my career. I have a particularly strong interest in the intersection of services with the web and mobile devices.

Outside of work, I'm an avid cyclist and skier.
